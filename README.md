15 Feb 24: Had another (very) brief session trying to scrape some memory of my HTML and CSS lessons. Im using MDN and re-discovering how good it is as a reference and guide tool. Managed to get some basic elements added onto the index.html and get them linked to the CSS stylesheet. Also got my code editor configured to link direct to GitHub via CodeSpaces which seems to be a good way to go about things. Will likely still using the terminal (in VSCode) where I can as I was starting to enjoy and get used to the basic commands to process changes. The code learning journey continues slowly.

16 Feb 24: Managed to reaquaint myself with grids, their baorders and padding. Got the HTML sorted as well, remembering to stick everything in a div! Decided to use this practice site as a personal blog site to document the journey of building this practice environment. Realised that i need to provide class names for most, if not all, of the divs that are created. MDN really is a great tool, however, looking at this post as i type, it hasnt helped my spelling much... :D That and i dont like how my ul is looking - time to explore how to insert images into the html to show what it looks like.
