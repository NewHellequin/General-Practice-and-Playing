15 Feb 24: Had another (very) breif session trying to scrape some memory of my HTML and CSS lessons. Im using MDN and re-discovering how good it is as a reference and guide tool. Managed to get some basic elements added onto the index.html and get them linked to the CSS stylesheet. Also got my code editor configured to link direct to GitHub via CodeSpaces which seems to be a good way to go about things. Will likely still using the terminal (in VSCode) where I can as I was starting to enjoy and get used to the basic commands to process changes. The code learning journey continues slowly.
